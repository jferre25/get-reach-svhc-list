# get-reach-svhc-list

- py script to fetch the current svhc list as an xml file
- This script is geared toward helping people who are just kickstarting material compliance automation
- If you have questions about this script, or material compliance automation in general, please email me at jayferreira256@gmail.com

### Considerations
- If the SVHC list exceeds 1000, then the value should be updated on line 31
- This script will save the SVHC list in the same folder as itself as an xml
